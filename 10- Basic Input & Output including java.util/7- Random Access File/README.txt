This example is described in the Description text file
It tends to use the Adventure Game example from the Collection examples to implement IO
So far with character streams and Byte streams we read the data sequentially from the file
start from the beginning of the file to the end
The Random Access File allows us to jump inside the file to read the required data instead of
reading the data sequentially to reach the required data.
That saves memory and the number of accessing the file
we use the term offset which is a byte location in a file, that helps to point to a specific point
in a file
